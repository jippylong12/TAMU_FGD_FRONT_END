I just want        this to be helpful to whoever uses. It's very simple and I don't know how much I'll update in terms of aesthetics, but I        will keep updating the course data as long as I can.</p>         <p>It should have most of the classes. There are 12 total colleges I pull the data from and the whole list can be found         <a href="https://goo.gl/snAx65">with the source code.</a> If you are interested in improving what I've done then feel free. If you want         the csv files I use as the back end to the server they can be found <a href="https://goo.gl/bgahxe"> here.</a> Also you can find the         php and css files I use for the server <a href="https://goo.gl/IRBoHK"> here. </a>         </p>        <p style="text-align: center"><b>I'm glad this website is helping people. </b> </p>        <p style="text-align: center"><b>NEW!
